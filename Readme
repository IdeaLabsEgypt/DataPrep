[SQL dump]
about the SQL dump (rared) for storage purposes. (will attach link to it later)

to use this dump do the following:
- unrar the file into a .sql file
- open "MySQL workbench"
- import the .sql into the MySQL workbench

NOTE:
it's better if the connection string would be the same for the code to work on any machine

[features]
the file "features" is the file holds the compiled feature vector for the whole apps (~1M app).
it was generated using the method run() in file InputDataFormatter

[file to database conversion]
the file jsonToMySQLconverter handles the conversion methods between the json to the sql insert statement.
it dropped about 500 apps in the process because of non-unicode encoding errors. and the workaround was a little time consuming to do.
